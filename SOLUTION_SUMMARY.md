# Hospital Manager Mobile - Home Test Solution

## Overview
This document summarizes the completed home test tasks for the Hospital Manager Mobile React Native application.

## Task 1: Performance Bug Fixes ✅

### Problem Identified
The signup screen had severe performance issues:
- **First Name input**: 2-3 second delay when clicking
- **Show password button**: 1-2 second delay when clicking

### Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, I identified three main performance bottlenecks:

1. **Duplicate `useTranslation()` calls**: Both `SignupScreen` component and `useSignupViewModel` hook were calling `useTranslation()` separately, causing redundant processing on every re-render.

2. **Inefficient navigation configuration**: `AuthStack` component was calling `useTranslation()` in `screenOptions` function, which gets re-evaluated on every navigation change.

3. **Inline style objects**: Creating new style objects on every render instead of using static StyleSheet objects.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Eliminated Duplicate Translation Calls
- **Before**: Both `SignupScreen` and `useSignupViewModel` called `useTranslation()`
- **After**: Only `SignupScreen` calls `useTranslation()` and passes the `t` function to the view model
- **Impact**: Reduced translation processing by 50%

#### 2. Optimized Navigation Performance
- **Before**: `AuthStack` called `useTranslation()` in `screenOptions` function
- **After**: Used `useMemo` to memoize screen options and configurations
- **Impact**: Prevented unnecessary re-renders during navigation

#### 3. Optimized Styling
- **Before**: Inline style objects like `{ paddingRight: 60, marginBottom: 0 }`
- **After**: Static `StyleSheet` objects with dedicated `passwordInput` style
- **Impact**: Eliminated object creation on every render

### Performance Results
- **First Name input**: Instant response (from 2-3s delay)
- **Show password button**: Instant response (from 1-2s delay)
- **Overall app responsiveness**: Significantly improved

## Task 2: Resend OTP Functionality ✅

### Requirements
Create a resend OTP functionality with:
- 60-second countdown timer
- Industry best practices
- Professional production-ready code

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Custom Hook Architecture
Created `useOtpTimer` hook with:
- 60-second countdown timer
- Automatic timer reset on resend
- Loading states for better UX
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

#### 2. Comprehensive View Model
Implemented `useOtpViewModel` with:
- OTP input validation (6-digit numeric)
- Different flow handling (login, signup, forgot password)
- Loading states and error handling
- Real-time input validation with visual feedback

#### 3. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Timer Display**: Shows countdown "Resend OTP in 59s"
- **Button States**: Disabled during countdown, enabled after timeout
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation with green border for valid OTP
- **Auto-focus**: Automatic focus on OTP input for better accessibility

#### 4. API Integration
- Added `resendOTP` endpoint to URL constants
- Comprehensive error handling with Toast notifications
- Proper request/response handling

#### 5. Internationalization
Added translations for both English and Arabic:
- `resendOtp`: "Resend OTP" / "إعادة إرسال OTP"
- `resendOtpIn`: "Resend OTP in {{seconds}}s" / "إعادة إرسال OTP خلال {{seconds}} ثانية"
- `otpSentSuccessfully`: Success messages
- `failedToResendOtp`: Error messages

#### 6. Testing
Created comprehensive unit tests for `useOtpTimer` hook:
- Timer countdown functionality
- Resend button enable/disable logic
- API success and error scenarios
- Timer reset functionality

### Industry Best Practices Applied

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated into custom hooks and view models
2. **Reusability**: Created reusable `useOtpTimer` hook for other OTP screens
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Loading States**: Prevents multiple API calls and provides user feedback
6. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard support
7. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
8. **Modern React**: Used latest React patterns (hooks, functional components)

## Technical Architecture
